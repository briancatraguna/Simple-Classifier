# Simple-Classifier

This is a course team project for PH-GY 8013 Software Engineering for Scientific Computing Spring 2023. We want to simplify the process of comparing different machine learning classification models on various datasets. To achieve this goal we provide high level APIs that split datasets in multiple ways, construct model-dataset pairs, and run training, validation, and testing, and compare results based on a variety of metrics.
