# Simple-Classifier

This is a course team project for PH-GY 8013 Software Engineering for Scientific Computing Spring 2023. We want to simplify the process of comparing different machine learning classification models on various datasets. To achieve this goal we provide high level APIs that split datasets in multiple ways, construct model-dataset pairs, run training, validation, and testing, and compare and display results based on a variety of metrics in a selection of formats.

## Getting Started

This project needs at least Python 3.10. Create a virtual environment with your favorite tool (e.g. `conda` or `virtualenv`), and install the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`simple_classifier` can be executed as a cli tool or as a python package. To run the cli tool, use the following command:

```bash
simclf ...
```
